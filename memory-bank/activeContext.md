# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Recent Major Changes (Last Session)

### 🔐 Security Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: GitHub blocked push due to hardcoded Twilio secrets in config.py
- **Solution**: Moved all secrets to environment variables
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - All pushes now working

### 📍 Location-Based Delivery System
- **Implementation**: Complete GPS coordinate capture and storage
- **Features**: 
  - Order model updated with delivery_latitude/longitude
  - Haversine distance calculation for route optimization
  - LocationInput component with Google Maps integration
  - Nearby orders discovery API
  - Route optimization using nearest neighbor algorithm

### 🚀 Deployment Configuration
- **Created**: Comprehensive deployment guide for multiple platforms
- **Added**: Production environment configuration
- **Tools**: Secret generator script for secure deployment

## Current Work Focus

### 🧪 Testing Private Functions
- **Need**: Test private functions like `haversine_distance`
- **Challenge**: Access private functions from test files
- **Solution Needed**: Proper import patterns for testing

### 📦 Missing Documentation Files
- **Status**: Some memory bank files deleted during git operations
- **Action**: Recreating essential documentation
- **Priority**: Restore complete project context

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Complete Testing Setup**: Fix private function testing access
2. **Memory Bank Recovery**: Restore all missing documentation
3. **Production Deployment**: Use deployment guide for live deployment
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize delivery algorithms

## Current System Status

### Backend (FastAPI)
- ✅ Location-based orders working
- ✅ Route optimization implemented
- ✅ Database schema updated with location fields
- ✅ All secrets properly configured

### Frontend (Next.js)
- ✅ LocationInput component ready
- ✅ Google Maps integration working
- ⚠️ Need to integrate location picker in checkout

### Database
- ✅ SQLite with location columns added
- ✅ Migration completed successfully
- ✅ Test data with GPS coordinates

### Deployment
- ✅ Security issues resolved
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Documentation complete
- 🔄 Ready for production deployment

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Security First**: All secrets moved to environment variables
2. **Location Priority**: GPS coordinates essential for delivery optimization
3. **Testing Strategy**: Need comprehensive testing for private functions
4. **Deployment Target**: Railway + Vercel recommended stack

## Open Questions

1. How to properly test private functions in Python modules?
2. Should we create utility modules for shared functions like haversine_distance?
3. What additional location features are needed for production?
